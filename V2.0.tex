We examine a sample of SDSS galaxies with stellar masses between $10^{8.5}$ and $10^{11} \ M_{\odot}$ for signatures of radial feedback driven by bursty star formation. We measure each galaxy's offset from the median size-mass relation, and plot this size against their $H\alpha$ emission. Below $10^{9.5}\ M_{\odot}$, we see a positive correlation between galaxy concentration and $H\alpha$ emission, i.e., actively star-forming galaxies are more concentrated. This is observational evidence for a ``breathing'' mode of star formation, where intense star formation in the galactic center drives radial outflows of gas and stars in a cyclic fashion. More massive galaxies do not show the same correlations between size and star formation activity, consistent with the observations that these objects reside in cuspy dark matter halos.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

Dwarf galaxies, galaxies at or below stellar mass of $\sim 10^{9} M_{\odot}$, are important laboratories that allow us to study structure formation at the smallest scales. In particular, their ratios of baryons to dark matter are extremely low, typically around 1:100. This gives rise to important differences in the structure and star formation histories of dwarf galaxies as compared to more massive galaxies ($ M_{\star} > 10^{9} M_{\odot}$), and studying these differences can shed light on important physics related to how galaxy formation is regulated by both baryons and dark matter.

Cosmological simulations based on the preferred cold dark matter model ($\Lambda$CDM) predict that galaxies form in self-similar halos of dark matter, which have density profiles described by a double power law with an inner logarithmic slope of -1, termed a Navarro-Frank-White (NFW) profile \citep{NFW}. The distribution statistics and kinematics of massive galaxies is fully consistent with them living in dark matter halos with NFW profiles \citep{Wambsganss04,Springel05,BK09,Klypin11}; however, dwarf galaxy kinematics are better described by halos with a flat inner slope, typically referred to as a ``cored'' profile \citep{Moore94,McGaugh01,Marchesini02,Simon05,deblok08}. This tension between predictions made from $\Lambda CDM$ and observations is termed the ``core-cusp problem.'' A closely related problem, the ``too big to fail problem,''  notes that satellite halos (or subhalos) seen around Milky-Way-like galaxies in $\Lambda$CDM simulations are too dense to host any of the observed Milky Way dwarf satellites \citep{BK11,BK12}. Note that these two problems may indeed be two manifestations of the same problem, i.e., both problems may be solved if halos in the real Universe have cored profiles. Recent work by \cite{GK14} demonstrated that the ``too big to fail'' problem extended beyond the Milky Way's virial radius, suggesting that the problem has more to do with how dwarf galaxies form than how environmental effects such as ram-pressure stripping or tidal interactions manifest (See, e.g., \citet{Gunn72,Larson80,Farouki81,Moore96,Balogh2000} for a discussion of these effects).

In order to resolve these problems, one of two things must be true. Either the underlying physics of $\Lambda$CDM must be modified in some way, or baryonic processes must be invoked to bridge the gap between theory and observation. Recent work has been dedicated to exploring both possibilities. On the cosmological side, both self-interacting dark matter and warm dark matter can serve to suppress structure formation and lower the central densities of dark matter halos \citep{Lovell14,Elbert14}. With respect to baryonic matter, supernova feedback has long been known to deposit energy into the interstellar medium (ISM), driving galactic winds \citep{Larson74,Dekel86}. More recently, this feedback has been posited as a mechanism by which energy may be injected into dark matter particles, kinematically warming them. Several authors have argued that if star formation proceeds in bursts in dwarf galaxies, energy will be injected with enough efficiency to create cores in the centers of dark matter halos \citep{Governato10,Governato12,PG12}. Observational studies have demonstrated that, for dwarf galaxies in particular, the star formation rate as measured by $H\alpha$ has more scatter than the star formation rate as measured by FUV emission \citep{Sullivan00,Boselli09,Lee09,Shivaei15,Guo16,Sparre17}. Since these indicators trace star formation over different timescales, these studies are consistent with a picture where star formation in dwarfs is stochastically bursty; however, radial transport driven by this stochastic star formation remains unobserved.

One clue to resolving this dilemma may lie in how dwarf galaxies' old stars are distributed. While exceptions abound, massive galaxies generally have concentrations of old stars in the center, and younger stars in the outskirts \citep{dejong96,Bakos08}. Dwarf galaxies, on the other hand, typically show the inverse; young stars in the center and old stars on the outskirts \citep{Hidalgo09,Hidalgo13}. Several studies have argued that these radial age gradients arise from in situ formation; old stars in the external region were born there at early times and generally remained there, exhibiting only minor radial movement with no preferred direction \citep{Stinson09,Schroyen13}. However, recent simulations have raised the possibility that stars in dwarf galaxies experience significant radial transport; young stars are born in galactic interiors, then at some point in their lifetimes they move to larger radii, possibly driven by feedback \citep{Gonz16,EB17}. Distinguishing between these two possibilities could shed light on the physics behind dwarf galaxy formation.

A unified model of galaxy formation that solves these problems was first put forward by \cite{Navarro96}, where the authors show that feedback driven outflows can produce galaxies in simulations with realistically cored profiles. Further studies \citep{Governato10,Governato12,Maxwell12,DC14,Pontzen14,Chan15,EB17} refined the theory, specifying that feedback regulates dwarf galaxy star formation in a stochastic manner and powers radial transport, but an observational smoking gun for this model remains elusive. 

In this study, we use observations of both dwarf galaxies and massive galaxies to investigate the observational predictions of a model for dwarf galaxy formation whereby stochastic star formation in the center of the galaxy powers radial transport of both baryonic and dark matter. Specifically, our study will focus on the structure of star forming galaxies, and how that structure is dependent on the vigor with which the galaxy is forming stars. The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we discuss the data used in the study, in Section 3 we present our results, and in Section 4 we discuss the implications of the work. Throughout the paper we use h=0.7, and unless otherwise noted, star formation rates are calculated according to \cite{KS98}. 

\section{Data and observations}
\label{sec:obs}

The data used in this study come from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey \citep[SDSS,][]{SDSS}, making use of the NYU and MPA-JHU value-added galactic catalogs \citep{Kauffmann03,Brinchmann04,blanton05vagc}. To select our scientific sample, we first take all galaxies with stellar masses between $10^{8}\ M_{\odot}$ and $10^{11}\ M_{\odot}$. We require galaxies in our scientific sample to be actively star forming, so we impose a minimum $H\alpha$ equivalent width of $2 \rm \AA$ and require that the galaxies we select reside in the star forming region of the BPT diagram \citep{BPT}. We admit to the scientific sample only galaxies within a mass-dependent completeness redshift, estimated by dividing the sample into five mass bins of width 0.5 dex and plotting a histogram of the redshift of galaxies in each bin. The peak of the histogram was taken to be the approximate completeness limit for the scientific sample. These limits, as well as the number of galaxies in our sample, are given in Table 1. In Figure \ref{fig:size_sfr} we plot the star formation rate of the galaxies in our sample versus their physical size. We note that galaxies above masses of $10^{9.5}$, we see few low star formation rate objects with large size, as seen by \citet{Patel18}, but this trend goes away at lower masses.

%We also put together a sample that would be used to calibrate our required fiber corrections. This sample was selected in exactly the same way as the scientific sample, except the completeness requirement was relaxed; galaxies were permitted into the calibration sample if they were within two times the completeness limit of the scientific sample. In \ref{sec:fibercor}, we describe how this calibration sample is used.

\subsection{Central star formation}
\label{sec:fibercor}
SDSS spectroscopy is based on light being channeled into fibers $3$ arcsec in diameter. This gives us an opportunity to more closely probe the star formation rate in the galaxy's central regions. Since we will be interested in star formation happening in the galaxy's center, we will define a fiber-corrected star formation rate that intentionally over weights the fiber measurement taken at the galaxy center, which we will call $SFR_{\rm cent}$. Eventually, we will be interested in whether or not $SFR_{\rm cent}$ is larger or smaller than the galaxy's true star formation rate, which will give us a measure of how centrally concentrated the star formation is, but first we will detail how $SFR_{\rm cent}$ is calculated.

We begin by defining a parameter $\Psi$ that corresponds to the fraction of a galaxy's area on the sky that lies within the fiber. For galaxies smaller than 3 arcsec, $\Psi = 1$. For larger galaxies, $\Psi = \frac{A_z}{\pi R^2}$, where R is the circularized radius of the galaxy measured in kpc (taken to be \textit{r}-band R90 so as to account for nearly all light from the galaxy) and $A_z$ is the area of a circle of diameter 3 arcsec at the redshift of the galaxy. Figure \ref{fig:geo} shows $\Psi$ plotted against galaxy radius for galaxies in our $10^{9.5}-10^{10}\ M_{\odot}$ bin. Notice that, as one might expect, larger galaxies tend to have more of their area fall outside out the fiber, leading to lower values of $\Psi$. The selection effect in the upper right portion of the plot is introduced by the redshift cut we place on the sample. An object that lies on this line is located close to the maximum allowed redshift, such that it is the minimum size on the sky, and thus the largest $\Psi$. 

If we are carrying out a correction on some generic parameter $\Theta$, which could represent e.g. star formation rate, we assume that the correction will take the form of a power law, i.e., $$\Theta_{\rm total} = \Theta_{\rm fiber} \times \Psi^{-\alpha}.$$ Here $\alpha$ is a power law index that we will derive empirically and $\Theta_{\rm fiber}$ is the measured value of $\Theta$ within the fiber. In calculating $\alpha$, our goal is to correct $\Theta$ such that its distribution is independent of redshift. We assume no redshift evolution within our full sample, which is a fair assumption between z=0 and z=0.07. Then we fit a linear relationship to $\log \Theta_{fiber}$ and $\log \Psi$. The slope of this relationship we adopt as $\alpha$. This fitting procedure can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:steps}.

To validate that our correction procedure does indeed produce a measure for $\Theta$ that is independent of redshift, we divide each mass bin into a low redshift subsample and high redshift subsample\footnote{We use ``high" redshift in a relative sense; all galaxies we consider in this paper are quite low redshift.}. Galaxies with redshift less than $z_{complete}/2$ are placed in the low redshift subsample, and with redshifts between $z_{complete}/2$ and  $z_{complete}$ in the high redshift sample. In applying the correction, we will call the measured value of the parameter of interest $\Theta_{fiber}$. We then compare the distributions in $\Theta_{total}$ between the low and high redshift sample. This comparison is shown in $H_\alpha$ luminosity in Figure \ref{fig:hist} for the $M_\star \sim 10^{9.5} M_{\odot}$ bin. We see excellent agreement in the corrected values across redshift for each mass bin, and note that this agreement is only seen after the correction is made. Table 1  contains the measured alphas for each sample mass bin. If we substitute $SFR$ for the generic $\Theta$ in the above derivation, we can make explicit the definition $$SFR_{\rm cent} \equiv SFR_{\rm fiber} \times \Psi^{-\alpha}$$.

\subsection{Concentration/luminosity degeneracy}
\label{sec:concdep}
As previously mentioned, the above procedure produces a measure for $SFR_{\rm cent}$ that is overly reliant on information from the galaxy's center. If two galaxies have the same $\Psi$ and $SFR_{\rm fiber}$, they would end up with the same $SFR_{\rm cent}$, even if one of them had substantially more star formation in its outskirts (and thus a higher true star formation rate). Essentially, using the parameter $SFR_{\rm cent}$ introduces a degeneracy between a galaxy's true star formation rate and the concentration of its star formation. Note that, had we simply corrected for the area outside of the fiber (i.e., applied an $\alpha= 1$ correction), we would have been degenerate in redshift as well.

To investigate this degeneracy, we carried out a simple Monte Carlo simulation with toy models of galaxies. The galaxies were divided into an inner and outer region, each with a separate star formation density. Galaxies were divided into two categories: those with greater star formation rate density in the center, and those with greater star formation rate density in the outskirts; i.e. galaxies with central star formation and galaxies with star formation in the disk. We then applied the same steps described above to determine a $SFR_{\rm cent}$ for our simulated galaxies. To remove the variation due to intrinsic star formation, we normalize $SFR_{\rm cent}$ by each galaxy's intrinsic star formation rate. This allows us to examine $ \log \frac{SFR_{\rm cent}}{SFR}$ for each galaxy as the ``central excess" in star formation. Upon plotting $\frac{SFR_{\rm cent}}{SFR}$ vs. $\Psi$, for the toy galaxies, the two models occupy distinct regions of parameter space, with the objects centrally concentrated star formation having the highest $\frac{SFR_{\rm cent}}{SFR}$ and those with low central star formation displaying the lowest $\frac{SFR_{\rm cent}}{SFR}$. This is shown in the left panel of Figure \ref{fig:model}. If we color the points in $ \log \frac{SFR_{\rm cent}}{SFR}$ vs. $\Psi$ space by concentration (i.e., R90/R50) we can see a correspondence between high $\log \frac{SFR_{\rm cent}}{SFR}$ and concentration, as shown in the right panel of Figure \ref{fig:model}. We will therefore use the ratio between $SFR_{\rm cent}$ and $SFR$ as a proxy for the concentration of star formation in our galaxies. Note that while $\log \frac{SFR_{\rm cent}}{SFR}$ can serve as a proxy for concentration, we can not establish a one-to-one mapping between $\log \frac{SFR_{\rm cent}}{SFR}$ and concentration.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

In this section we will examine the relationship between a galaxy's physical size (as probed by \textit{r}-band R90) and the rate and concentration of its star formation. By dividing our sample into bins of 0.5 dex in stellar mass, we can examine how the relationship between size and $H\alpha$ emission varies with galaxy mass. Of particular interest is what happens at dwarf-scale masses, i.e., the lowest two mass bins of our sample.

To establish a mass-independent size metric, we fit a mass-size relation to all star-forming galaxies below redshift 0.03, then determine the expected size for each galaxy in the sample based on its stellar mass. For each galaxy, we then calculate a ``size offset" which is the logarithm of the ratio between the actual size of the galaxy in kpc and the expected size of that galaxy, also in kpc. This size offset parameter has the useful properties of being centered at or very close to zero for any given population of galaxies, and having relatively consistent scatter (about 0.4 dex) over the mass ranges we probe.

%In Figure \ref{fig:HA_ew}, we plot the total (i.e. aperture-corrected) $H\alpha$ equivalent width against the size offset parameters in four stellar mass bins. There is an anti-correlation in $H \alpha$ equivalent width with galaxy size in all four bins, however  this anti-correlation is most significant in the lowest mass bin. To emphasize this point, we show the median equivalent width for galaxies with negative size offset (i.e. smaller size, black points) and positive size offset (i.e. larger size, green points) as horizontal lines. In Figure \ref{fig:HA_ew_mass}, we show the difference between these two medians plotted against stellar mass. Here, $\rm \Delta log(H_{\alpha}\ EW)$ is defined to be the median equivalent width of the larger galaxies minus that of the smaller galaxies. Here it is apparent that equivalent widths of the sample at $10^{8.5} \ M_{\odot}$ are significantly lower than those at higher masses.

In Figure \ref{fig:sfr}, we plot star formation rate against size offset for galaxies in each mass bin. As expected, star formation tends to increase with increasing mass. Within each mass bin, we plot the average star formation rate at fixed size offset as a blue line. The broad trend we see is a positive slope from in the dwarf-scale mass bins, such that smaller galaxies are relatively less star forming, which transitions to a nearly flat relation in the highest mass bin.

If, however, we plot the slope of our size/star formation rate relation against the stellar mass of the galaxies in each bin (Figure \ref{fig:HA_lum_mass}), we see a more complicated behavior. Rather than monotonically decreasing with stellar mass, the slope turns over $10^{8.5} M_{\odot}$  and again at $10^{9.5} M_{\odot}$. The size of the error bars makes it unclear whether or not the turnover at $10^{8.5} M_{\odot}$ is real, however the turnover at $10^{9.5} M_{\odot}$ seems to indeed be real.

We see a very similar result when we examine the star formation rate density\footnote{Where $\Sigma_{SFR} = SFR/\pi R_{90}^2$.} with respect to size and mass. Figure \ref{fig:sfrdens} shows the average star formation rate density plotted against size offset for galaxies in our six bins, while Figure \ref{fig:HA_dens_mass} shows the dependence of the slope of that relation on galactic stellar mass. Unsurprisingly, we see essentially the same trends, with a strong maximum at  $10^{9.5} M_{\odot}$ and a weak minimum at $10^{8.5} M_{\odot}$.

\subsection{Central Star Formation}
\label{sec:conc}

In section \ref{sec:concdep}, we discuss how the ratio $log \frac{SFR_{\rm cent}}{SFR}$, which describes the deviation in total star formation implied by the galaxy's center from the true star formation rate, can be used to probe galaxy concentration. We turn now to examining how this ratio varies with galaxy size and mass.

In Figure \ref{fig:sfr_ex}, we plot the relationship between $log \frac{SFR_{\rm cent}}{SFR}$ and size offset for galaxies in the five mass bins. The first thing we notice is that large-sized objects in the $10^{8} \ M_{\odot}$ bin have highly enhanced $log \frac{SFR_{\rm cent}}{SFR}$ as compared to the rest of the sample, suggesting that these galaxies have significantly denser star formation than more massive objects. Among the other five bins, we a negative correlation in the  $10^{9} M_{\odot}$ bin gradually flatten with increasing mass. This is very apparent when we plot the slopes of these relations against stellar mass in Figure \ref{fig:HA_ex_mass}, and represents an enhancement in star formation density among small-size objects unique to dwarf galaxies.

Similarly, in Figure \ref{fig:sfr_ex}, we plot the relationship between $log \frac{SFR_{\rm cent}}{SFR}$ and star formation rate. First considering dwarf galaxies, we see no correlation in the $10^{8} \ M_{\odot}$ bin and a significant positive correlation in the $10^{8.5} \ M_{\odot}$ bin. We see a negative correlation in all other bins. The implication is that dwarfs with high star formation have concentrated star formation, while the opposite is true for more massive galaxies.

In Figure \ref{fig:HA_duty}, we plot $\frac{SFR_{\rm cent}}{SFR}$ versus size offset for the $10^{8.5} M_{\odot}$ mass bin. We define with objects with $\frac{SFR_{\rm cent}}{SFR} > 0$ as centrally star forming objects, while galaxies with $\frac{SFR_{\rm cent}}{SFR} < 0$ are objects that preferentially form objects in the outer regions. These results are shown in the figure; the line through the two dimensional histogram separates these two populations. We measure the fraction of objects observed to be in the central phase to be 0.62, which under the assumption that these represent distinct phases in galactic evolution, is equivalent to a measurement of the duty cycle. In Section \ref{(sec:discuss)}, we will use this value to comment on the physics at play in these systems.

%\subsection{Radial dependencies}

%Here we present the radial profiles in $H_{\alpha}$ luminosity for galaxies in our sample. In addition to each galaxy's total $H_{\alpha}$ luminosity, we can probe the properties at the physical radius corresponding to the radius of the fiber. Then, by binning in physical radius, we can construct the average $H_{\alpha}$ profile for galaxies in each mass bin.

%Figure \ref{fig:grad_lum} shows this average $H\alpha$ luminosity profile among galaxies across the four mass bins. At small radii (below $\rm \log R =0.6$), the galaxies obey the same power law relationship across all five mass bins. Above that radius, the low mass points fall off of this power law relation while the high mass points continue along the power law. Physically, this means that low mass galaxies have very little $H\alpha$ at larger radii, while high mass galaxies have similar amounts at all radii.

\section{Discussion}
\label{(sec:discuss)}
%\subsection{Radial Dependencies}


\subsection{Galaxy Size}

An important prediction of the ``breathing'' model of feedback regulation in dwarf galaxies is that star formation rate is anti-correlated with galaxy size. In the model, stars are formed in the galactic center. Supernova feedback from these young stars then blows out the reservoir of gas from which the stars were formed, dampening star formation. As a result, galaxies are actively forming stars when they are at their smallest. During the subsequent blowout phase the galaxy will be more diffuse and, if the galactic wind drives radial transport, the galaxy will have a larger effective radius \citep{EB17}. 

We don't see an anti-correlation between size and star formation rate, meaning that this prediction of breathing is not borne out. However, we do see a relatively higher star formation rate among small-sized objects in dwarf mass ranges, as indicated by the decline in the slope of the star formation rate vs. size relation at small masses. This is consistent with a picture whereby small dwarf galaxies have somewhat enhanced star formation relative to their physical size over their intermediate-mass counterparts.

 Furthermore, taking $\frac{SFR_{cent}}{SFR}$ as a proxy for concentration, we see an enhancement in concentration in small-size dwarf galaxies, seen as an inflection or "kink" in the concentration-size relationship as seen in Figure \ref{fig:excess}. At higher masses, however, this relationship flattens, and the inflexion goes away. This trend could evidence for a breathing mode of feedback-regulated star formation in high-mass dwarfs. Indeed, the evidence from concentration is stronger than the evidence from size, suggesting that further investigation into where star formation occurs in dwarf galaxies is necessary.

There are, however, potential alternate explanations for the observed effects we point out. We will briefly discuss these. Firstly, we will consider the possibility that galaxies at different sizes do form stars at the same rate, but different amounts of $H\alpha$ emission could be produced per unit star formation. This could be due to variations in the initial mass function (IMF), which sets the rates at which stars of different masses form. A top-heavy IMF, where more massive stars are formed relatively more frequently, would result in more ionizing radiation being formed per unit star formation. Our results could potentially be explained by smaller galaxies having more top-heavy IMFs, and correspondingly relatively more $H_{\alpha}$ emission. Whether or not the IMF varies between galaxies, or within galaxies, is an area of active research, with most results being consistent with a universal IMF \citep[e.g.,][]{Lee09,Bastian10}. 

An alternate possibility is that galaxies form stars at the same rate and as described by the same IMF at the same mass, but dust obscures star formation in such a way as to create a trend where there would otherwise be none. However, previous studies have shown that dust reddening increases with increasing stellar mass \citep{Garn10}, leaving it unlikely to drive an effect seen primarily at dwarf masses. We see a similar result in our data, with Balmer decrement increasing with increasing galaxy mass. Thus we conclude that dust extinction is unlikely to be the driver of the effects we see.

\subsection{Duty Cycle and Energetics}

In Section \ref{sec:results}, we divide the galaxies in our lowest mass bin into objects forming stars in their centers (i.e. objects with high $H_{\alpha}$ concentrations) and objects forming stars in their outer regions (i.e. objects with low $H_{\alpha}$ concentrations) by drawing a line at $\frac{SFR_cent}{SFR} = 0$. Galaxies above that line are centrally star forming, while those below the line belong to the group forming stars in their outskirts. Assuming that these represent phases of star formation, we define the duty cycle of this population to be the fraction of time a galaxy spends in its central phase, as estimated by the fraction of galaxies observed to be in the central phase, and measure this value to be 0.60; i.e., dwarf galaxies spend roughly sixty percent of their lifespan in a phase where they most are actively forming stars in their centers and the other sixty percent not in this phase. Due to the increased size of the galaxy during the passively star forming phase, we will interpret this to be the phase where the galaxy is undergoing stellar feedback-driven blowouts. There are several different interpretations for this measured duty cycle that we now discuss.

Firstly, we will examine this number under the view that the instantaneous star formation rate in dwarf galaxies at a particular time is a stochastic sampling of an underlying probability distribution of star formation rates. Of course, this view is only sensible as an approximation; nevertheless, there are benefits to thinking of star formation in this way, particularly as it pertains to generating analytic and semi-analytic models \citep{Kelson16}. 

Under this probabilistic interpretation, a galaxy's star formation rate represents a sampling of an underlying star formation rate probability distribution function. Our result suggest that the probability of galaxies being in the ``central" state is 1.5 times higher as the galaxies in the ``outer" state. We draw a distinction between these phase transitions and final quenching, when a galaxy becomes ``red and dead." This final quenching phase is likely not a result of stochastic sampling of an underlying pdf, but rather the result of physical processes that bring the galaxy out of the ``breathing'' mode and into the ``red and dead'' mode. In particular, galaxies at these masses are predominantly quenched through environmental means \citep{Kauffmann03, geha12}.

Physically, we can interpret the galaxy's duty cycle in terms of the times that galaxy spends in each phase in order to explore the physical scalings and energetics involved. As an example, we use the test case of a $10^9 M_{\odot}$ galaxy of radius 5 kpc. Assuming that the blowout moves with the speed $v_{wind}$, the total time it takes to reach the galaxy edge is $\frac{R}{v_{wind}}$. If the material takes the same amount of time to fall back onto the center as to reach the galactic outskirts\footnote{It's worth noting that, in the FIRE simulations, the recollapse is slower than the initial expulsion}, then the total time spent in the passive phase is twice this time. Using the duty cycle implied by Figure \ref{fig:HA_duty}, we can conclude empirically that the time spent in the central phase during a single burst is $$t_{active} = .6 \times\frac{2 \times R}{v_{wind}} = 195. Myr \times \frac{R}{5 kpc}\times \frac{30 km/s}{v_{wind}},  $$ consistent with the timescales put forward by \cite{EB17}. Multiplying this value by the star formation rate of objects in the active phase gives us the total number of stars formed in one cycle:
$$\Delta M_{\star} = 3.51 \times 10^7 M_{\odot} \times \frac{SFR}{0.180 M_{\odot}/yr} \times \frac{t_{active}}{195 Myr}$$.

The IMF allows us to connect the amount of star formation in a burst to the strength of the supernova feedback produced by that burst. Under a Kroupa IMF \citep{Kroupa02}, we expect one Type II supernova for every 100 solar masses in stars formed, meaning that a single burst in a dwarf galaxy produces some $3.5 \times 10^5$ Type II supernova. Given that the average energy output of a Type II supernova is $10^{51}$ erg, the total energy output during a single burst is $3 \times 10^{56}$ erg. In order to produce $10^8.5 M_{\odot}$ of stellar mass, the galaxy must have gone through $10$ cycles, thereby producing $3 \times 10^{57}$ erg of supernova energy in the process during these episodes of centralized star formation. The energetic argument presented in the above paragraph is true independent of whether the stars are formed constantly or in bursts. However, as several authors have argued \citep{Governato12,GK13}, the ``bursty'' mode of star formation can produce a positive feedback cycle, where the the efficiency of subsequent bursts increases from the initial burst \cite[see][]{Pontzen12,Governato12}. 

%To further examine how energetics of a ``bursty" galaxy can drive core formation, let us consider two spherically symmetric dark matter halos of total mass $10^9 \rm M_{\odot}$ within 10 Mpc, both with core radii of $r_0 = 400$ pc, both with total radii of $r_{max} = 100$ kpc and both with double power law density profiles: $$\rho(r) = \frac{\rho_0}{(r/r_0)^a(1+r/r_0)^b}$$.
%We will consider the first halo to have  an NFW profile (a=1,b=2) \cite{NFW}, while the second has a flat inner profile (a=0,b=3). We can integrate the expression $$U = -G\int_{0}^{r_{max}} \frac{M(<r) \rho(r) dV}{r}$$ to compute the gravitational binding energy for each halo. Carrying this integral out, we find a binding energy of $-5.04 \times 10^{56}$ erg for the NFW halo and $-3.61\times 10^{56})$ erg for the cored halo. Thus, we must input at least $1.42 \times 10^{56}$ erg in order to go from an NFW halo to a cored halo at halo mass $10^{9} \rm M_{\odot}$. 

%We turn now to examine supernova as the source of this energy. We may write the amount of energy that each supernova contributes to the system as $\epsilon \chi E_{SN}$, where $\epsilon$ is the ``natural" coupling efficiency between a single supernova and the surrounding dark matter, $\chi$ is the boost in efficiency due to positive feedback from the previous bursts, and $E_{SN}$ is the amount of energy released in a single supernova. Thus, the total energy deposited in the halo is $$E = \sum_{i = 1}^{n_{SN}} \epsilon \chi_i E_{SN} = \epsilon <\chi> n_{SN} E_{SN}$$. We can use the previously-discussed values for the energy released by supernova over a dwarf galaxies and for the energy required to produce a core to arrive at $\epsilon <\chi> = 0.014$; however, there is much physics hiding in the $\chi_{i}s$. For example, the star formation histories of more-massive galaxies are less bursty \citep{Guo16} than those of dwarf galaxies, so the coupling between the supernova and the dark matter is likely smaller, preventing core formation. Examining dwarf galaxies at higher redshift will shed further light on the evolution of their density profiles and how density cores are produced over cosmic time.

\subsection{Comparisons to Simulations}

Hydrodynamical simulations whereby galaxy growth is regulated through burst-driven radial transport make a number of specific, testable predictions of galaxy observables. We divide our discussion of these predictions into two sections: predictions concerning galaxy dynamics, which we do not address but is addressed by \cite{Cicone16}, and predictions concerning galaxy structure, which is the primary concern of this work.

The burst-driven transport model of galaxy self-regulation requires that feedback not only couple to the gas in a galaxy, but also to the stellar component. As a result, the stars are kinematically heated, resulting in an increased line of sight velocity dispersion. \cite{El-Badry17} makes this prediction explicit, demonstrating a correlation between $\sigma_{LOS}$ and specific star formation rate for star particles in the final 40 snapshots of one simulated dwarf galaxy halo. Under the assumption that the evolution of this single halo is an ergodic process, this supplies a prediction for the population of dwarf galaxies at low redshift.

These predictions are borne out by the analysis of \cite{Cicone16}, which uses stacked SDSS spectra to examine the profiles of nebular emission lines and stellar absorption lines, constraining the dynamics of galactic gas and stars respectively. They find that, for dwarf galaxies, the width of stellar absorption lines increases with increasing specific star formation rate, consistent with the predictions of \cite{El-Badry17}. Furthermore, they find that this trend disappears above stellar masses of $10^{9.5} M_{\odot}$, consistent with the prediction that burst-driven transport only operates at dwarf mass scales.

On the other hand, \cite{Patel18} claim they see no evidence for a breathing mode of star formation among isolated intermediate-mass galaxies in COSMOS. We do agree that the evidence for this breathing mode is not very convincing at the mass range ($10^{9}-10^{9.5} M_{\odot}$) they consider; however, the evidence is stronger at masses half a dex lower. In particular, we compare their Figure 3b with out Figures \ref{fig:dens_slope} and \ref{fig:dens_bin}. While at high masses, we see no correlation between $\frac{SFR_{cent}}{SFR}$ and $SFR$, at lower masses, we see an increase in density among high star formation rate objects, consistent with a breathing-like process.

We can also compare the trends with size that we have explored in this work to predictions from hydrodynamical simulations. In Figure \ref{fig:predict}, we over plot sizes and star formation rates in the final 40 snapshots from the M10.6 (halo mass $\sim 10^{10.6} \  M_{\odot}$) galaxy in the FIRE simulation\footnote{These 40 snapshots are roughly evenly spaced between $z=0$ and $z=0.02$.} \citep{EB17}, measured in such a way with as to mimic SDSS observations, alongside galaxies from our lowest-mass bin ($10^{8.5}-10^{9.0} M_{\odot}$) in specific star formation rate/size space. Again, we emphasize that since the simulated galaxies evolve in this space, the points traced by the galaxy in the simulation make a prediction for galaxies sampled in the real Universe. We see agreement between the predictions made by the simulation and our observed relationship between specific star formation rate and size. There is significantly more scatter in the observed relation than the simulation results, which is a natural result of comparing an ensemble of galaxies with a single simulated object, but the overall agreement between simulations and data is striking. Taken together, these two observational confirmations of simulation predictions provide strong evidence that burst-driven radial transport is occurring in dwarf galaxies.

\section{Conclusion}

Our study primarily examines the relationship between the physical size of a galaxy and it's star formation properties. We show the following,

\begin{itemize}
\item The slopes of the star formation rate vs. size relations for galaxies binned by mass suggest that small-sized dwarf galaxies have more internal support, possibly from feedback, than small-sized, more massive galaxies.

\item Comparisons of fiber-derived star formation rate to total star formation rate imply that star formation is centrally concentrated in small-sized galaxies in dwarf galaxies of mass $10^{8.5}-10^{9} \  M_{\odot}$ and high star formation rate galaxies in dwarf galaxies of mass $10^{8.5}-10^{9.5} \  M_{\odot}$

\item Taken together, these results are consistent with a picture where dwarf galaxies experience cycles of star formation, where dense star formation in the central regions drives blowouts that self-regulate galaxy growth. However, we find, in agreement with \citet{Patel18} that this effect does not impart a \textit{strong} anti-correlation between star formation rate and size. However, we do see reasonable agreement with simulations that exhibit such blowouts.

\item We find that the evidence from concentration is stronger than the evidence from size. Our ongoing work involves using slitless spectroscopy to localize star formation within dwarf galaxies to examine them for breathing-induced concentration effects.

%\appendix{Comparison to color-based aperture corrections}

%Here we compare our aperture correction method to one similar to that of \cite{Brinchmann04}. In order to correct for the size of the SDSS fiber, the authors developed a methodology whereby a spectroscopic measurement (e.g. star formation rate) was associated with the fiber $gri$ colors of the galaxy, the the properties of the galaxy outside of the fiber were inferred from the gri colors of the portion of the galaxy located outside of the fiber. Here, we adopt a similar methodology for the purposes of comparison. 

%%We adopt a simple, yet effective relation to estimate $H\alpha$ equivalent width from galaxy color:

%%$$\rm log EW_{H\alpha} = 2-%%2\times(\textit{g-r}) $$

%%

%We first make use of the fiber g-r and r-i colors to estimate to estimate the measured fiber equivalent width. We divide the sample in half, and use the two colors as features in decision-tree regression algorithm fit to fiber $H\alpha$ equivalent widths. We then use the algorithm to predict the fiber $H\alpha$ equivalent width in the unused half of the sample. The agreement between the prediction derived from the colors and the spectroscopic measurement is seen in Figure \ref{fig:ccheck}. Then, we estimate the total $H\alpha$ equivalent width from the galaxies' total colors. The red contours in Figure \ref{fig:ccheck} demonstrate the agreement between the equivalent width estimated in this way and the equivalent width determined from the fiber corrections described in \ref{sec:fibercor}.

%Below $10^{9.5}$ solar masses, we see the agreement between the two methodologies break down. Predictions of total galaxy $H\alpha$ equivalent widths based on fiber color will tend to be overestimates, particularly in low equivalent width systems. This observation  in line with what \cite{Salim07} argued; the relation between color and SSFR established in star forming galaxies breaks down in galaxies without $H\alpha$. We point out that this also extends to regions of galaxies that do not emit $H\alpha$, which impacts fiber corrections even within star forming galaxies.
